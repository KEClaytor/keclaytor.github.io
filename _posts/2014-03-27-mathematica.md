# Multiple, Multiply Sided Dice

I recently contributed a demonstrations to the [wolfram demonstrations project](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/).

[Multiple, Multiply Sided Dice](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/MultipleMultiplySidedDiceProbability/)

This allows you to quickly view the probability distributions for obtaining certain values from rolling many dice of varying sizes (two to twenty sided).
This can be really helpful for getting a feel for how likely it is to achieve a certain result or better.
I'm using it for game design - it helps me decide which types and how many dice to use.
