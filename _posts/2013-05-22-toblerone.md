This is a 21 element clock made from Toblerone boxes.
Powered by a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/), it has a [twitter account](https://twitter.com/tobleroneclock) that it monitors and then prints the tweets, character by character, on its clock face.
It can also run a [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) simulation modified for a triangular grid.

You can get the source code off of [GitHub](https://github.com/KEClaytor/HexPi).

Here's a cool video of it in action:
