# Netrunner Laser-Cut Identities II
After the success of the [last Netrunner laser-cut ID's](/2023/06/03/netrunner-ids.html) I thought I would do another set for East Coast Nationals 2023. 
This was right before [Smoke](https://netrunnerdb.com/find/?q=smoke) (one of my favorite runners) was going to rotate, and [The Outfit](https://netrunnerdb.com/find/?q=the+outfit) was doing super strong, so I had an easy time deciding what to do.

For this one, however, I had recently learned about inlaying and adjusting for the laser kerf (the width of the cut).
Basically, what you do is you take the inlay and enlarge it uniformly by ~0.04" or whatever your kerf ends up being, then they should press-fit tightly together.

Smoke is a wood base with an inlaid translucent red hair, and turned out better than my expectations:

I ended up making multiple outfits, as I would have a little bit of waste that I then wanted to use again.
The green translucent background shows a bit of the scorching from the cutting, but the others turned out very well - I think the black background with the translucent green inlay is my favorite.

Here are the vector art files if you'd like to make your own.
Note that I generally design them 90% in Inkscape (free) and then transfer them over to CorelDraw (paid) when I'm on the laser, since that's what it needs.
Hence the SVG files need a bit of work to get out what you see in the images, whereas the CDR files are what I actually put into the cutter.
