# Updated the webpage

I've updated my webpage using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and the [bulma clean theme](https://github.com/chrisrhymes/bulma-clean-theme).

Make sure you have the latest copy of the theme with `bundle update`.

Getting Jekyll up and running was alright, it seems the `bundle exec` ecosystem is similar to the python virtual environments.

Another good option is [using a pre-build fork-able site](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).
