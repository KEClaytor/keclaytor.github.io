Found a great little [customizable arrow fletching jig](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3694889) on thingiverse.

You can customize it to your arrow diameter, fletching length, width, number and helical / straight.
Perhaps not as versatile as a full on fletching jig, but for my level of archery it's way easier, cheaper, and faster to just print a few of these than invest in a jig.
I've been using this one for awhile now and quite like it.

If you're using plastic nocks there's no issue, but I've learned that if you're using pin nocks to either a) extend the holder to account for the pin, or b) add a hole for the pin in post-processing.

My saying for 3d printers is they make 90% boxes and toys, but I think this one has to go in the not-a-box-or-toy category.
