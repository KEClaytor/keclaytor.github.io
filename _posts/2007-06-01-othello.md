# Othello

## Introduction and Download

A GUI for playing Othello against yourself or the computer, includes such features as;
- 1 or 2 player mode
- 4 option difficulty setting ranging from Wimpy (no edge weighting, only looks 1 move ahead) to Difficult (severe edge weighting, looks 6 moves ahead)
- Rules dialog if you forget, or don't know how.

Installation:
1. MCR Installer - The MATLAB component runtime that must be installed before running the program installer.
2. [Othello_pkg](/assets/exe/Othello_pkg.exe) - Standalone executable (windows only)
3. [Othello.m](/assets/mfiles/Othello.m) - Matlab file

## Installation
If the Matlab Runtime has not been installed download and install the Matlab runtime file.  Then download the counter_pkg.exe program and run it.  This will create counter.exe which is the standalone application.  Alternatively you can download the Matlab files in a .zip package and run from the Matlab command prompt.
